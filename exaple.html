          <h1>Sabrina Desir my soulmate, and my future wife</h1>
          <h3>Before I met you, I didn’t think love was for me. It was something other people had and felt. Something in movies and in TV shows. It felt more like a wish I had than something real. Now that I’m with you, love is so much more tangible. It’s something I can reach out and touch. It’s so much more than a wish or a hope, it’s the very real, wonderful person I wake up to. The warm hand next to mine, the brush of hair against my cheek. I love you and I love so much more than you because of that love. I love myself and the world in a way I never thought possible. You’ve made that possible for me. You’ve made everything possible.</h3>
          <h3>Everything you do… The way you eat, smile, and my name rolls off of your tongue… That all is what keeps me going. It gives me so much joy to watch you be you. I would never give my attention to anyone else because I love giving it to you. The day when you were born, it was raining. Actually, it wasn’t raining itself, but heaven was crying for losing the most beautiful angel!  I can create another odyssey describing my love for you. You have such a profound influence in my life that I cannot erase the memories of you even if I live for a million years. I am lucky to be part of your life. I will love you till my last breath!</h3>
