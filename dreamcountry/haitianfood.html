                <p>On January 1, 1804, Haiti not only became the second nation in the Americas to gain its independence from European rule but also the first free Black republic. Haiti’s freedom came after a long, violent slave revolt — the first successful one since the initiation of the trans-Atlantic slave trade nearly two centuries earlier. Many Haitians recount tales from that era of a pumpkin soup that the French colonizers enjoyed and forbade slaves from consuming.
                    Now Haitians  commemorate their hard-fought freedom every year on New Year’s Day by eating soup joumou, a puree of soft, mild Caribbean pumpkin cooked with beef stock. Cabbage, pasta, carrots, plantains, root vegetables, celery, and various cuts of beef that can include ribs and trotters are added to that soup base.</p>

                <p>Diri ak djon djon is one of the most extravagant and unique dishes in Haitian cuisine. Often translated as “black rice” or “black mushroom rice,” diri means rice in Kreyòl, and djon djon is the Kreyòl word for fungus, referring to a variety of mushrooms found in northern Haiti. Similar mushrooms are found throughout the Caribbean, but Haitians are the only people in the region to feature them prominently in their cuisine.</p>

                <p>Fritay refers to fried foods. Certain fritay, like the seasoned grated malanga fritters called akra, can trace their lineage directly back to West Africa, where similar preparations exist with the same name. Perhaps the simplest fritay is patat, slices of deep fried white sweet potatoes typically served as a snack or side dish. Bannann peze — fried slices of green plantain that are pressed into flat discs and fried again — are ubiquitous in Haitian cuisine, and similar to plantain preparations found throughout the Caribbean.</p>
