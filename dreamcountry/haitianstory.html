            <p> During the Arcahaie Congress, Dessalines, on May 18, 1803, removes the white band from the French flag – which was used in Haiti during the French rule, and thereby creates the first Haitian flag, symbol of the alliance of blacks and mulattos in their fight for freedom. Dessalines, who orders that the phrase “Freedom or Death” be inscribed on the flag, is soon nominated General of the Insurrection.</p>

            <p> The Battle of Vertières (Haitian Creole: Batay de Vètyè) was the last major battle of the Haitian Revolution, and the final part of the Revolution under Jean Jacques Dessalines. It was fought on 18 November 1803 between the enslaved Haitian army and Napoleon's French expeditionary forces, who were committed to regaining control of the island.By the end of October 1803, the forces fighting the expeditionary troops had already taken over most of the territory of St. Domingue. The only places controlled by the French forces were Môle St. Nicolas, held by Noailles, and Cap-Français, where, with 5,000 troops, French General Rochambeau was at bay.</p>
